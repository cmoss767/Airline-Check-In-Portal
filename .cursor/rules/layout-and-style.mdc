# Directory Layout & Coding Style

-   **Co-locate Server Actions:** Server-side logic like data fetching and mutations should be placed in an `actions.ts` file alongside the page or components that use it (e.g., `src/app/admin/actions.ts`).

-   **API Routes are for External Endpoints ONLY:** The `src/app/api/` directory should only be used for creating public, URL-addressable endpoints. The only API route in this project should be the CRON job (`/api/cron/expire-checkins`), which needs a public URL to be triggered by an external scheduler. All other client-server communication must use Server Actions.

-   **Centralized Hooks:** Place all reusable custom hooks in the `src/hooks` directory.

-   **Styling:** Always use Tailwind CSS for styling. Do not add component-specific CSS/SCSS files or use inline style objects.

-   **Package Manager:** Use `pnpm` for all dependency management.
